I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I have the distinct honor of working under the guidance of Dr. Sebastian Scherer, at the <a href='https://theairlab.org/'>AirLab</a>, Robotics Institute. My primary research project centers on the <a href='https://theairlab.org/multidrone/'>Dense 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Actors in Natural Environments using Multiple Flying Cameras</a>. I am passionately driving this project forward by implementing a learning-based human pose 3D reconstruction pipeline, leveraging simulated datasets from Isaac Sim.

Prior to this, I served as a research assistant at <a href='https://en.scu.edu.cn/'>Sichuan University</a>. My focus was on optimizing the thermal mechanical properties of 3D printed lattice structures using deep learning and genetic algorithms. This research aligns with the growing interest in employing varied lattice designs to cool the trailing edges of turbine airfoils, especially with the progress in airfoil manufacturing technologies.

I obtained my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering jointly from the <a href='https://www.pitt.edu/'>University of Pittsburgh</a> and <a href='https://en.scu.edu.cn/'>Sichuan University</a>. My time at the University of Pittsburgh was particularly transformative, where I explored the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science through a minor.

My primary interests lie in Robotics and Computer Vision, where I constantly seek to explore, innovate, and deepen my understanding. I welcome opportunities for collaboration and am eager to establish connections in these fields. If you share similar interests, please don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we can pioneer new horizons!
