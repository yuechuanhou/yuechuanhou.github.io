## Introduction

In response to the heightened need for accessible health monitoring tools due to the global pandemic, this project focused on the development of a home-based respiratory testing apparatus. The device's purpose is to enable individuals to conduct simple yet accurate respiratory tests, such as measuring peak breath force and total volumetric lung flow, transforming home environments into proactive health management spaces. This initiative directly addresses public health concerns, allowing for early detection of respiratory issues and reducing the strain on healthcare systems.

## Methods

The apparatus was designed using a steel beam (12.7 mm wide, 0.305 mm thick, 72 mm long) combined with a strain gauge. The device's efficiency and accuracy in measuring respiratory parameters were tested using a simulated lung function pump. This setup allowed for the estimation of average and peak breath forces, alongside the measurement of total volumetric lung flow. Additionally, a calibration process was employed using known masses to ensure the precision and reliability of the sensor's readings.

## Results

The device effectively measured key respiratory parameters with good sensitivity, indicated by a static sensitivity of 1.5522 V/N. Despite minor discrepancies due to measurement and circuitry limitations, the device demonstrated reliable performance in simulating lung function, proving its usefulness for home-based respiratory monitoring.

## Discussion

The project successfully developed a practical, cost-effective, and user-friendly respiratory testing device suitable for home use. The social value of this invention lies in its potential to empower individuals to monitor their respiratory health, thereby facilitating early detection of problems and reducing the need for clinical visits. Future improvements include using thicker beams for enhanced force handling, implementing fixed supports for test stability, enclosing the beam to protect from environmental factors, and refining circuitry components to minimize measurement errors.

## Conclusion

This project represents a significant step towards accessible respiratory health monitoring, offering a precise, professional, and socially valuable solution. The device's design and functionality align with the need for simplified yet reliable health tools in a post-pandemic world, emphasizing the importance of preventive healthcare measures.
